# Take-Home Coding Challenge (Notable)

To test the API functionality, use the following command line signature:
```python3 main.py PATH_TO_TXT```

where PATH_TO_TXT should be the filepath to your text file with the transcription text that needs to be formatted. An example file ```input.txt``` is included for demonstrative purposes.

You may also add tests to the file ```tests.py``` and run ```python3 tests.py``` to test for expected functionality. The file already includes a few basic tests.

To view the code implementation, see ```transcription_format_api.py```.
